- Hello, I’m Jackson Woodside (jdwoo)!
- I’m interested in coding and have been learning/implementing code on my own and for school since elementary!
- My most recently learned language was Go, and my most recently used was JavaScript.
- Currently this account's repos are private, and I use another Github account for school, so commits/additions may seem sparse.
