- Hello, I’m Jackson Woodside (jdwoo)!
- I’m interested in coding and have been learning/implementing code on my own and for school since elementary!
- My most recently learned languages was Go.
- Most of my repos are private, so commits/additions may seem sparse (since most are not available to view on the publicly facing profile).

<!---
jdwoo090/jdwoo090 is a ✨ special ✨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.
